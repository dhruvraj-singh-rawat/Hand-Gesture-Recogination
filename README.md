# Hand Gesture Recogination

This project is a result of the Assignment in IIP subject taught in UG 4 year at LNMIIT where the main aim is to create a robust model which can solve a important problem using computer vision

## Motivation
* Humans interact with each other on many levels. Communication is one of the key feature which separates humans from other species.
 

## Getting Started

Following are the instruction to you need to follow to get this project up and running into your local machine for testing and development purporse.
